Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color.
On the moons of Mars two little Nicco√≤ sing very lonely.
they dont what to do they dont know where to go
no people they can hug no aliends to high five
and then Claire starts mocking them

'Boh" they say, 'boh to the rain, we're so lonely alone without my giuliano'
